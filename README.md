**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

I ensure functionality by writing focused unit tests before or alongside implementation. I validate edge cases and typical flows. I run tests continuously after each change. I track coverage to catch untested logic and refactor when tests reveal design smells. For security, I follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, using the principle of least privilege, and handling IDs with care. I run static analysis and dependency checks to spot vulnerable libraries. I avoid exposing sensitive data in logs or error messages. These habits provide rapid feedback and reduce the chances of defects reaching production.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I start by translating requirements into small, testable behaviors and user stories with clear acceptance criteria. From there, I model data and operations that directly support those behaviors, prioritizing clarity over complexity. When trade-offs arise, I rely on the stated goals (performance, usability, reliability) and incorporate feedback loops, tests that encode requirements, as well as quick iterations that confirm the feature aligns with real usage expectations.

**How do I approach designing software?**

My design approach is iterative and modular. I define simple, cohesive classes with clear responsibilities. I minimize coupling between components so changes in one area do not ripple through the codebase. I prefer interfaces and small public APIs, which make testing easier and enable future extensions. Diagrams or brief sketches help clarify data flow early. After that, I let the tests guide refinements, keeping the design lean, readable, and maintainable.
